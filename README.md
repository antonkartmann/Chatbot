# Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot written in Python, designed to help users with basic interaction. The chatbot recognizes predefined patterns and responds accordingly. It was created as an example to showcase how to build a basic rule-based chatbot without any external libraries.

## Features
- The chatbot can greet users, ask how they are, and respond to questions about its name.
- It can handle unknown inputs with a fallback response.
- The user can exit the chatbot by typing "exit".
  
## How it Works
- The chatbot checks the user's input and matches it to a list of predefined patterns (such as greetings or questions about the chatbot's name).
- If a match is found, it returns a relevant response. If no match is found, it provides a default fallback response.
  
## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed.

## Usage
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the script is located.
3. Run the chatbot by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
